# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., responsive reminder setup, fast startup, low battery impact or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., offline-capable, account-free core use, accessible large text, local notifications or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Answer each gate with PASS, FAIL, or N/A. FAIL requires an entry in Complexity
Tracking before implementation planning may continue.

- **Simplicity and clear flows**: Primary user flow is short, obvious, and avoids
  unnecessary configuration. Added settings, dependencies, services, screens, or
  abstractions are justified.
- **Setup/onboarding UX baseline**: User-facing setup or onboarding flows follow
  `docs/ux-design.md` for flow shape, tone, layout, interaction, accessibility,
  and calm progression.
- **Accessibility for older adults**: Large text, screen reader behavior,
  contrast, touch targets, non-color-only status, and error recovery are covered
  for affected flows.
- **Reliable local-first reminders**: Core reminder behavior works offline,
  account-free, and with deterministic local notification scheduling.
- **Privacy and user control**: Medication data stays local/private by default;
  any sharing, backup, analytics, donation, or remote service is optional,
  minimal, and documented.
- **Maintainable architecture**: Domain rules, persistence, notification
  scheduling, and UI concerns remain testable and appropriately separated.
- **Testing gate**: Required automated and manual verification are identified,
  including recurrence, permissions, persistence, accessibility, localization,
  and privacy behavior where relevant.
- **Consistent, localizable experience**: User-visible strings, dates, times,
  dosage labels, notifications, empty states, and errors are ready for English
  and Latin American Spanish.
- **Measured performance**: Startup, reminder setup responsiveness, background
  work, battery impact, and dependency size are considered with measurable goals.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
